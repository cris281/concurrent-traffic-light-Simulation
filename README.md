## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the concurrent-traffic-light-Simulation! This application allows you to simulate multithreaded traffic management in a virtual city. You will see vehicles navigate through a grid, following traffic lights at intersections. The software showcases key programming concepts like concurrency and thread safety.

## 🛠️ System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS, or a modern Linux distribution.
- **Processor:** 1.0 GHz or faster.
- **RAM:** Minimum 2 GB.
- **Software:** An OpenGL compatible graphics driver is recommended.

## 📥 Download & Install

2. Use the on-screen controls to start and stop the simulation.
3. Watch as vehicles respond to traffic lights and navigate through intersections.

## 🔍 Exploring the Code
While you may not be a programmer, you can learn from the underlying code. The application is written in C++17 and demonstrates important concepts such as mutexes, condition variables, and message queues.

## 📝 Topics Covered
- **Concurrency:** Learn how multiple tasks can run simultaneously.
- **Condition Variables:** Understand how tasks can wait for a signal before proceeding.
- **Message Queues:** Discover how information is passed between threads safely.
- **RAII:** Experience resource management techniques that help protect against memory leaks.

## 💡 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues running the application, consider the following:
- Ensure your operating system meets the system requirements.
- Check that your graphics driver is up to date.
- Restart your computer to resolve any temporary software glitches.
